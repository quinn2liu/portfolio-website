This project was created using Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and is deployed using ???.

This is my first portfolio site and I'm really happy with how it turned out! A goal of mine might be to create a new version every year.

Credits: The HackerText component comes from Hyperplexed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5oawMJaXbU&ab_channel=Hyperplexed). I am nowhere near good enough to fully comprehend the code especially translated into a react component.

Here are some potential features I will be looking to implement in the future:

1. Create a "Leave a Note" section for site visitors to be able to add a message. 

2. Migrating contents onto one page.

3. Adding more animations across the entire page.

    - specifically, a little avatar that will track the cursor across the screen 

4. Actually understand the HackerText component.

Here are some potential fixes I need to put in place:

1. the images on the about page when on mobile aren't animating properly, reconsider how to get rid of that
